Java Table Test
---------------

These are some classes to help testing Java programs using fixtures and 
assertions. It's *based* - read that? - on the way we use fixtures and
assertions on Ruby on Rails. The fixtures and database configuration file
are YAML based and require the use of JYAML libraries 
(http://jyaml.sourceforge.net).

The examples uses SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org) and the SqliteJDBC 
libraries (http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc).
